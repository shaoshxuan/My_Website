# Shao Shxuan's Portfolio Website

This website is developed as a means to practice and showcase my proficiencies as a developer, a portfolio website. It consists of an overview of who I am, what proficiencies and skills I hold, my work experience, the past and ongoing projects I am currently involved in, as well as a way to contact me for freelance jobs.

It will definitely be improved over iterations. Currently, it is built with GatsbyJS, which is a static site building made on top of ReactJS. I have also implemented styling with SCSS with it's live compiler to translate styles to CSS. Retrieving of data was done with API calls to Contentful CMS with GraphQL.
